# Pricing

The solution is free for extraction up to 3GB as a trial. If you require more than this to evaluate the product then please [get in touch]({% link docs/contact-us.md %})!

## Cloud Pricing

Cloud pricing is $30/month which includes 25GB of storage. Additional storage is priced at $0.2/GB monthly. Typical savings are between a 80-90% reduction when compared to Zendesk additional storage unit fees.

## Hybrid Pricing

Hybrid pricing is $60/month, extraction is charged only at the time of extraction at $1/GB.

For instance if in month 1 you extracted an initial 120GB, the cost would be $180. In month 2 if you then extracted a further 10GB, the cost would be $70. Any months you do not extract, you will only incur the $60/month cost.

## Volume Discounts
